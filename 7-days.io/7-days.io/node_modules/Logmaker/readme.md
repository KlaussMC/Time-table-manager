Use Logmaker to simply and easily log any traces of your node program

to use Logmaker, all you need to do is:

    const logmaker = require("logmaker");
    logmaker.enable();

this enables the logger and can now be used.
to log something, simly type:

    logmaker.log(whatever);

the log files are stored in a directory called "logs", it is located in the Logmaker's doctree.
The logs are named by date.

to clear a log, simply enter:

    logmaker.clearToday();

this will clear the enitre logfile, this can only be done to the current logfile,
ability to clear other files will come soon.

to prevent the logger from writing to files, simply write:

    logmaker.disable()

this will stop the logger, (it can be reenabled at any time)

one more thing, the logger will also begin a new "section" which is just a divider within the current file, simply by entering:

    logmaker.newSection();

the logger will only work if it is enabled, no changes to the logfiles will be made unless logmaker.enable() is called.

v 1.2.0 -

new functions are available:

    - newLog()
        this function creates a new log file and sets it as the current working file.
        it takes a file name as a parameter.

        there is no need to add ".log"

        if no value is passed, the file will be named by date with the number of previous files of that date added in brackets.
        i.e. (29-10-2017(1).log)

    - changeCurrentLog()
        this function does what it says on the tin. it changes the working log file.
        enter the new file as a parameter

        logmaker.changeCurrentLog("10")

        this will set the log to "10.log"

        logmaker.changeCurrentLog(-1)

        will set the current log to today's date - 1 (yesterday's log)
        Note: this can be any number as long as it's a negative number

        logmaker.changeCurrentLog("today")

        will set the current log to the log that goes by the date.
        i.e.    29-10-2017.
